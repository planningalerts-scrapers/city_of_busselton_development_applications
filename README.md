[Applications Issued, Determined and Lodged](https://www.busselton.wa.gov.au/plan-and-build/planning-and-building-resources/applications-issued-determined-lodged)

"Applications Lodged" links for the current year and previous year are links to PDFs covering the whole year.
The scraper fetches the first (current year) PDF and continues to the second (prior year) PDF only if it has
not yet found a date range ending more than 30 days ago — this naturally handles the January overlap without
any special date logic in `ApplicationsLodgedPage`.

Format: Each PDF is a concatenation of weekly "Applications Lodged – DD/MM/YYYY – DD/MM/YYYY" documents,
ordered from the most recent week to the earliest week for the year. The date range heading repeats on every
page of each weekly section.

Since late August 2026, newly generated weekly sections use a new template: the heading reads
"Applications Lodged – DD/MM/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY" (the word "to" as the range separator, with single-digit
days possible) and may be split across two adjacent text nodes in the converted XML. Older sections in the
same PDF keep the original single-node en-dash format, so the scraper accepts both.

Each weekly section lists one or more groups (eg "Development Applications" or "Building Applications"),
each preceded by a bold group heading and a table with columns:

* Application Number
* Description
* Primary Property Address
* Date Application Received
* Date Deemed Complete *(later Development Applications only — ignored by scraper)*

Notes:

* There is a fixed header and footer region; the data table/s and group headings is contained between them, and rows
  are split across pages when they do not fit.
* Table headings are not repeated on a continuation of a table onto following pages;
* Group headings do not force a page break (a new table starts below)
* Table headings are sometimes split mid-word, eg "Applicatio" on one line and "n Number" on the next line. A list of
  known headings is maintained to handle this to determine if a space should be inserted between lines or not.
    * This implies that column alignment may vary
* Table headings may change with the addition of "Date Deemed Complete", though this was not seen in the last 30 days
* Cell contents are normally aligned to the bottom of the row.
* When a row is split across pages, the first page holds as much of each cell that fits, with the
  remaining cell content appearing on the following page. The scraper uses `previous_record` to handle this.
* html2xml may merge text from two columns, which may cause classification issues, we handle this by 
  * moving the 2nd word from council reference to address if present, eg: "BAC26/0109 Certified:"
  * moving dates at the end of addresses to date_received and ignoring multiple dates for date_received
